# Ethics Project: Survey Data Collection and Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on creating, collecting, and analyzing survey data to explore ethical considerations within a chosen topic. By employing Python for data cleaning and Tableau for visualizing insights, the project highlights the process of gathering and preparing data for meaningful analysis and reporting.

## Steps Followed

1. **Survey Creation**:  
   Designed a survey targeting a specific audience and collected responses from a sample population over at least 10 trials.

2. **Data Collection**:  
   Collected raw survey responses and saved them into a CSV file named `Survey1.csv`.

3. **Data Preparation and Cleaning**:  
   Cleaned and prepared the raw survey data for analysis using Python. The cleaned dataset was saved as `Survey2.csv`.

4. **Data Analysis**:  
   - Pivoted and refined the data as necessary for analysis.
   - Conducted a detailed analysis of the survey responses using visualization tools like Tableau and Excel.

5. **Insights and Reporting**:  
   Visualized key findings and insights in Tableau, presenting results in a clear and engaging format. The project report summarizing the methodology and outcomes is included in the repository as a PDF file.
